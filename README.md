# Hi, I’m Dhansika 👋

I focus on building strong computer science foundations using Python, with an emphasis on logic, clarity, and problem-solving rather than shortcuts or copy-paste code.

## What I’m Working On
- Strengthening Python fundamentals through hands-on programs  
- Writing clean, readable, terminal-based applications  
- Developing logical thinking using conditions, loops, and user interaction  
- Learning Git & GitHub through real project workflows  

## Featured Repository
🔹 **Python Foundations**  
A collection of 11 beginner-level Python programs designed to reinforce core concepts such as:
- Variables and data types  
- Conditional logic (`if / elif / else`)  
- Loops (`while`, `while True`)  
- Mathematical problem-solving  
- String operations  
- User input handling  

All programs are interactive and terminal-based, focused on logic rather than UI.

## Skills
- Python (fundamentals)  
- Logical problem solving  
- Command-line programs  
- Git & GitHub basics  

## Approach
I believe strong fundamentals matter more than rushing into advanced tools.  
I prefer understanding *why* something works before scaling it further.

**Building step by step. No shortcuts.**
